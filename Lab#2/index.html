                <h1>About Onyx</h1>
                <p>
                    Onyx is a mid range AM5 mini ITX computer. All parts have been hand chosen to give the best price to
                    perfomance without compromizing in apperance and with room to upgrade in the future. Although it is
                    a small form factor build it packs more than enough perfomance to play any game. The upside of SFF
                    (small form factor) builds is obviously the size and portability. This usualy comes with the
                    negatives of limited performance and higher prices. Onyx minimizes these downsideds by being able to
                    support a 240mm all in one liquid cooler and a full size graphics card while maintaining the small
                    footprint while keeping the price resonable. The part total comes to just under $1,500 before tax
                    going any lower would compromize perfomance, asthetics, and upgrablity. Many hours went in to
                    reserching and planing this build to make sure each and every part was the best value.

                    <h1>The Case</h1>
                    <p>
                        For Onyx the Lian Li A4-H20 was chosen as the case. It is an 11L case with a footprint of 5.51" by
                        12.83" and I hight of 9.61". This is not the smalest case out there but that's because it can fit a
                        240mm aio (all in one) liquid cooler and up to a 322mm graphics card. This is important for Onyx
                        because it makes it so we don't have to compromize on our CPU or graphics card. It is also
                        compatible with SFX or SFX-L power supplies. It has a sandwitch layout meaning there is a divider in
                        the center of the case that seperates the graphics card and motherboard. This helps with making the
                        case have a lower footprint by removing unused space. It also puts the graphics card fans right up
                        against the mesh side pannel for maximum airflow. Becuse the graphics card is seperate from the
                        motherboard a riser cable is used. Along with all these practical benifits of the case it also has a
                        clean minimalist asthetic with an angular front io cuttout. The rest of the build contiues this
                        design language to create not only a powerful but beautiful computer.

                    <h1>The Motherboard</h1>
                    <p>
                        The motherbord chosen for Onyx is the ASRock B850I Lightning WiFi. The ASUS ROG Strix B650E-I Gaming
                        WiFi was also considered but currently is $40 more expensive and the B650 boards are being
                        discontiued and would need a BIOS update for newer CPUs. The ASRock B850I has 2.5g ethernet as well
                        as WiFi 6E so wether you are on the go or at home you will have blazing fast internet. For back USB
                        connections it has one USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-C that functions as a display port, it also has 2 USB 3.2
                        Gen2 Type-A ports, 1 USB 3.2 Gen1 Type-A, and 4 USB 2.0 Type-A. The USB connections on the back
                        could be better but for the majority of gamers it's good enough. The display port USB Type-C is
                        perfect for a secondary monitor, The two USB 3.2 Gen2 Type A ports are perfect for the mouse and
                        keyboard while the 3.2 Gen1 is great for a microphone. The 4 USB 2.0 ports can be used for whatever
                        else is needed. Along with the back USB connections it has all the connections we need for the front
                        IO on the case. Another main reason this motherboard was chosen was for the back SPDIF port, this
                        allows for the connection of an audio DAC for much higher quality audio. Like most modern
                        motherboards it has a BIOS Flackback button for if you need to update your BIOS. For the PCIe slot
                        it is 5.0 x16 so it supports all current gen graphics cards. It also has 1 M.2 Gen5x4 on the front
                        with a heatshield and a M.2 Gen4x4 on the back for extra storage. For RAM it has 2 DDR5 slots that
                        can support up to 128gb and 8200mh which is more than enough. Overall it is the cheapest newest gen
                        mini ITX motherboard with all the connections needed.

                    <h1>The CPU</h1>
                    <p>
                        As a CPU for Onyx the AMD Ryzen 5 9600x was chosen. AMD was chosen over Intel becuss currently there
                        have been many issues with Intel CPUs and AMD is usualy better price to performance. Also AMD has
                        better future prospects, they contiue to release AM4 CPUs 9 years after it's release so the AM5
                        socket will likely be supported for years to come. Ryzen 5 was chosen over 7 or 9 because the extra
                        cores from those higher end CPUs are not needed unless you need it for productivity work or
                        streaming. There is little to no benifit in games unless you get an x3d CPU but those are outside
                        the budget of this build. Currently the 9000 series of CPUs are the newest from AMD and the 9600x is
                        about the same price as the previous generation 7600x, the 9600x also has a lower wattage meaning
                        lower temps which is good for ITX builds. It has great value for the price while being strong enough
                        to not bottleneck our GPU and power efficent so we don't have to worry about thermal throttling all
                        with the ability to upgrade later with the AM5 socket.

                    <h1>The CPU Cooler</h1>
                    <p>
                        To cool our CPU the ID-COOLING FROSTFLOW X 240mm AIO was picked. Altough our CPU could do just fine
                        with a low profile air cooler the case is built around liquid cooling and better cooling is always a
                        good thing along with in the future if upgrading the CPU a new cooler would not be needed. The
                        FROSTFLOW X was chosen in particualr because it is already know to fit in the case as well as
                        perform great. There are more expensive AIO coolers on the market but the slightly better
                        performance is not worth the price especialy because an AIO is already more than enought for the CPU
                        we chose and can support more powerful ones also if we do upgrade. The asthetics of the cooler also
                        fit Onyx, with a clean black design with subtle white LED glow on the pump head that will match the
                        white led glow of our GPU. Another benifit of using the AIO is the fans can be tuned down to be much
                        quieter than an air cooler and sill never thermal throttle the CPU. Overall this cooler offers more
                        than enough performance for the current CPU and future ones while also perfectly fitting the
                        asthetics of Onyx.

                    <h1>The Graphics Card (GPU)</h1>
                    <p>
                        For Onyx the GPU chosen is the XFX SWIFT Radion RX 9060XT 16gb. When chosing a GPU the main Choice
                        is between AMD and Nvidia, there are starting to be more options but they are still in their
                        infancy. For Onyx AMD was the better fit, they consitantly have better price to performance than
                        Nvidia. Nvidida has it's own benifits though with raytracing and DLSS along with being better for
                        content creators but for Onyx price to performance was valued more. The Nvidia equivialnt to the GPU
                        we picked is $50 more for the same performance which was considered a waste of money. Of the AMD
                        GPUs the RX 9060 XT 16gb was chosen for multiple resons, one of wich being it is the newest
                        generation with the newest technology including better raytracing further making it the better value
                        over Nvidia. The 9060xt is the lowest end card from the new generation but that doen't mean it is
                        weak, it is a solid 1440p gaming card that can run all modern games well. There are two options for
                        the 9060 XT one with 8gb of vram and one with 16b, the 16gb was chosen because modern games require
                        more and more vram so 12-16gb is considered the lowest you should go unless you only plan on playing
                        older titles. The 9060 XT also offers insane value for it's price to the point where in many
                        situations it beats used GPUs on price to performance. The XFX SWIFT was chozen as the specific
                        model because not only is it one of the cheapest options for the 9060 XT without any lower
                        performance or cooling but it also matches the asthetics of Onyx. Like the CPU cooler it has a clean
                        all black design with subtle white led accents. The XFX Mercury model was also considered because
                        for a while it was only $10-20 more for much better thermals but the price has risen recently to the
                        point where it is almost $40 more so it is no longer worth it. Another important thing to consider
                        when chosing a GPU and especaly with ITX is if it fits in the case and the XFX SWIFT fits perfectly.

                    <h1>The Power Supply Unit (PSU)</h1>
                    <p>
                        Chosing the right power supply can be difficult because the brand or rating matters much less than
                        the actual internals of the PSU. Because of this the PC building community have put together a tier
                        list that rates all the power supplies and give them a rating so this list was used to pick the
                        Cooler Master V750 SFX GOLD 750W as the power supply for Onyx. The PSU is rated A tier on the list
                        and is at a very resonable price for an SFX PSU. It is 80 Plus Gold certified which is pretty
                        standard, you can get higher effiency but for the majoraty of people and builds 80 Plus Gold is
                        perfect and going to a higher efficiency is a waste of money. The case we have for Onyx can support
                        SFX or SFX-L PSUs but everyone advises against the SFX-L units because they are slightly larger
                        leaving less room for cables managment in the already small case. For wattage 750 was chosen, it is
                        more that what is required for our build we could get away with a 600W but there are a couple of
                        reasons 750 was picked. Firstly there are very few 600W PSUs that are in the SFX form factor, and
                        they usualy cost the same if not more than the 750W PSUs so there's no reason not to go for the
                        higher wattage. Also 750W leaves room for upgrading componets to more powerful ones that require
                        more power without having to buy a new PSU. For asthetics most PSUs look about the same but the one
                        chosen for Onyx is all black. It does have the benifit of having unsleaved cables meaning they are
                        much more flexable which will help in our build with the size constraints, along with the PSU being
                        modular meaning no unneeded cables. It is the perfect blend of price to performance with added
                        functionality for the Onyx build.

                    <h1>The Random Access Memory (RAM)</h1>
                    <p>
                        For the RAM in an AM5 build the DDR5-6000 CL30 is considered the best price to perfomance, and for
                        ammount two 16gb sticks for a total of 32gb is considered what you need unless video editing or
                        other production jobs. The lower priced RAM that fit this requirement start at around $100, while
                        looking for the best fit for Onyx the Patriot Viper Elite 5 Ultra stood out. It is close to the
                        lower price at $110 but it is actualy CL28 which are usualy $130+ so for about the same price as
                        CL30 we can get better performance. Also at this time this exact ram was used in a world record
                        overclocked build by Linus Tech Tips, so if you wanted to push this memory you can. Along with the
                        amazing performance for the price it's asthetics are great, all black with an angled corner and
                        white text with logo making a very clean look. One unique thing that you have to think about with an
                        ITX build for ram is the hight of the ram getting in the way of the CPU cooler. The Viper Elite 5
                        Ultra is not the shortest ram at 44mm tall but it is short enough for the build because we are using
                        an AIO and can route the tubes around or over them, also other builds in the case use similar height
                        ram so it is a confirmed fit. The Viper Elite 5 Ultra is the perfect RAM for Onyx in price,
                        performance, and athetics.

                    <h1>The Solid State Drive (SSD)</h1>
                    <p>
                        For Onyx a PCIe 4.0 x4 NVME SSD was chosen as the storage. SSDs offer much better speeds than a hard
                        drive, also a hard drive would not fit in most SFF builds. A SATA SSD is also an option with the
                        case having room for one at the bottom but they roughly the same price as an NVME and have worse
                        speeds. NVME 4.0 was picked over NVME 5.0 because although they have better speeds it makes very
                        little to no differance in gaming, they are also much more expensive and run hotter than PCIE 4.0
                        usualy requiring a large heatsink or even one with a fan. Our motherboard does have a slot for a 5.0
                        on the front and 4.0 on the back also so if eventualy you want to get a 5.0 SSD you can move the
                        current 4.0 to the back and put the 5.0 on the fron of the motherboard. Now for the specific SSD for
                        Onyx the KingSpec XG7000 2TB was chosen with the help of the SSD tier list. The SSD tier list, like
                        the PSU tier list, was created by the commuity to rate SSDs on a variaty of criteria and give them a
                        rating from entry-level to high-end. The KingSpec XG7000 is considered a high-end SSD because of its
                        very fast read and write speed along with having DRAM. DRAM helps with incresed speeds for drives as
                        well as help with the lifespan of an SSD so it is very nice to have and why it was a requirment for
                        Onyx. Normaly this type of drive would be quite expenive but it is currently on sale for about the
                        same price as entry-level and mid-range SSDs, but may not be in the future so any high-end SSD with
                        DRAM on sale will work. For storage amount 2TB was picked this is plenty enough for most people
                        especialy to start, as stated earlier we have room for another NVME along with a SATA SSD if more
                        storage is needed later.

                    <p>
                        For Onyx there are a couple of additional things that are optional for functionality and asthetics
                        that will be listed in order of price. The first modification is actualy free, it is to remove the
                        sticker from the motherboard back IO cover. It has been done before and is as simple as pealing it
                        off maybe after removing they cover and applying a little heat with a hair dryer to make it easyer
                        and then cleaing the surface after. This leaves a clean black metal cover instead of the purple and
                        blue sticker that does not fit the asthetics of the build. The second cheapest addition would be two
                        120mm fan grills for the raditor fans. these make sure no cables interfere with the fan blades which
                        becomes more likely in an ITX build so they are highly recomended and are very cheap. Next is a can
                        of All-In-One matte white spray paint for case modification. The silver version of the Lian Li
                        A4-H20 has a black front IO cutout which crontrasts nicely with the silver but for the black version
                        of the case that we are using the front IO cutout it stays black making the case look a little flat
                        so the spraypaint would be used to repaint this one piece after removing it. In addition it a
                        stensil could be used to add a logo or designs to the case for customization. Lastly custom length
                        cables could be ordered for Onyx, these are quite expensive depening on where you get them and what
                        type you pic but they add to both function and asthetics. For function with cables the exact lenght
                        for the parts you have it makes cable management so much easier along with making for better airflow
                        so lower temps. For the astheics part, white cables would help bring the build together either
                        unsleved or the more expenive sleaved cables.
